    Rumble is a project of whom I am very proud to take part of. 
    It is an app with the goal of fighting sedentary lifestyle which is so common in the 21 century. 
    We started by converting the steps a person makes into coins, which he can use to get discounts  
    from businesses in Israel. After that, we added health articles which followed by a questionnaire, 
    walking competition between groups, public auctions for high value rewards and much more. 
    Today, We focus building a custom tailored version of the app for big organizations to use internal in the organization. 
    
    I worked at rumble as a full stack developer using Node js and React. 
    My responsibilities varied from creating and maintaining an online tool which its goal was to accessible to database to the non-developers in the company, 
    adding new features to the app, creating from scratch reports from the data of the company, and much more. 

    Since Rumble is still a small company, you have to be very independent in it. 
    I feel that this helped me learn how to learn new thing in an efficient, quick way.
    For example, When I first started working for Rumble, as a second year student, I had to learn React by myself, from scratch.
